# How to Contribute

To make sure WPO Stats never goes stale and becomes a comprehensive resouce, anyone can add additional studies using GitHub. We'd like to avoid making everyone go through the process of cloning the repo locally, so here's the easiest way to get a new case study onto the site:

1. Open up a [new issue](https://github.com/tkadlec/wpostats/issues/new?body=%23%23%20Key%20Takeaway%0A_Describe%20the%20key%20takeaway%20of%20the%20study%20in%20a%20sentence%20or%20two._%0A%0A%23%23%20Story%20Source%0A_e.g.%20%60http%3A%2F%2Fcanonical-source.com%60_%0A%0A%23%23%20Year%20published%0A%0A%23%23%20Tags%0A-%20list%0A-%20of%0A-%20appropriate%0A-%20tags&title=Study%20Submission%3A&labels=study), and fill out the template.
2. Wait for us to take the issue and add it to the list of studies.
3. Celebrate in the way you choose fit (preferrably with cake involved).

The only request we have is that all studies submitted be available online in some format (video, slide deck, blog post, etc). This way people who may want to reference any of these studies can point to the source when doing so.
