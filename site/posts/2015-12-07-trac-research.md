title:  "TRAC Research found, in a survey of 300 companies, that the average revenue loss for an hour of downtime was $21,000. For the same set of companies, average revenue loss due to an hour of slow performance (defined as load times exceeding 4.4 seconds) was $4,100. Website slowdowns occurred ten times more often than outages."
