title:  "Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) are tools that help websites comply with privacy regulations by obtaining user consent for the use of cookies and tracking technologies. In addition to the primary goal of ensuring legal compliance, CMPs, as third-party scripts, must also ensure minimal impact on performance and user experience. PubTech's Consent Management Platform reduced INP on their customers' websites by up to 64%, while also improving ad viewability by up to 1.5%."
